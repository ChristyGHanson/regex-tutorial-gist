* create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. 
* You'll use the template provided in the starter code to create your tutorial.

how to create a gist and its URL.

Instead of creating a repository, you’ll publish a GitHub gist. GitHub describes a gist as a simple way to share code snippets with others. It’s also an ideal way to demonstrate a technique, teach a principle, or show off a solution. It functions just like a repository, and you’ll use Markdown to create it, just as you do with your READMEs. Gists can include code, images, links, and anything else you can include in a README.

## What Is a Regex?
* A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.

* For example, the following regular expression can be used to verify that user input is a valid email address:

* /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

* Each component of this regex has a unique responsibility to make sure that a user enters an email address that begins with an unspecified number of characters preceding the @ symbol, followed by a domain.

* Before you get started, watch this introduction to regular expressions videoLinks to an external site. and read Regex Tutorial: Matching a UsernameLinks to an external site. to learn how to identify the different components that make up a regex.

* If you need any additional help, there are many resources on the web. Feel free to do your own research to find one that can help you complete this assignment.

Once you have a better understanding of what these different parts of a regular expression do, you’ll need to explain what they do for a specific regex.

You can choose one of the following regular expressions or you can choose one that you found on your own (with the exception of the one that is covered in the Regex Tutorial: Matching a UsernameLinks to an external site.:

Matching a Hex Value – /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
